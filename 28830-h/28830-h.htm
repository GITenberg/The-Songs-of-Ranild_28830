5</span>THE SONGS OF RANILD.</h2>
<h3>SONG THE FIRST.</h3>
<p>Up Riber&rsquo;s street the dance they ply,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Castle&rsquo;s won</i>, <i>the Castle&rsquo;s
won</i>!<br />
There dance the knights most merrily,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For young King Erik Erikson</i>.</p>
<p>On Riber&rsquo;s bridge the dance it goes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Castle&rsquo;s won</i>, <i>the Castle&rsquo;s
won</i>!<br />
There dance the knights in scollop&rsquo;d shoes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For young King Erik Erikson</i>.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas Riber Wolf the dance who led,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Castle&rsquo;s won</i>, <i>the Castle&rsquo;s
won</i>!<br />
In faith to his King he had been bred,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For young King Erik Erikson</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>And next him danced the Tage Mouse,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Castle&rsquo;s won</i>, <i>the Castle&rsquo;s
won</i>!<br />
Who Seneschal was in Ribe house,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For young King Erik Erikson</i>.</p>
<p>And then danced bold Sir Saltensee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Castle&rsquo;s won</i>, <i>the Castle&rsquo;s
won</i>!<br />
Followed by wealthy kinsmen three,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For young King Erik Erikson</i>.</p>
<p>The noble Limbekk dances next,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Castle&rsquo;s won</i>, <i>the Castle&rsquo;s
won</i>!<br />
Whose power the King had often vext,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For young King Erik Erikson</i>.</p>
<p>After him danced the Byrge Green,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Castle&rsquo;s won</i>, <i>the Castle&rsquo;s
won</i>!<br />
Then many a knight of handsome mien,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For young King Erik Erikson</i>.</p>
<p>And then came dancing Hanke Kann,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Castle&rsquo;s won</i>, <i>the Castle&rsquo;s
won</i>!<br />
His Lady followed, good Dame Ann,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For young King Erik Erikson</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>The next that came was the Ridder Rank,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Castle&rsquo;s won</i>, <i>the Castle&rsquo;s
won</i>!<br />
His Lady behind him, Berngard Blank,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For young King Erik Erikson</i>.</p>
<p>And then the high Volravn came,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Castle&rsquo;s won</i>, <i>the Castle&rsquo;s
won</i>!<br />
His wife behind, who has no name,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For young King Erik Erikson</i>.</p>
<p>And then came dancing Sir Iver Helt,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Castle&rsquo;s won</i>, <i>the Castle&rsquo;s
won</i>!<br />
Who followed his sovereign over the Belt,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For young King Erik Erikson</i>.</p>
<p>Long stood the Ranild Lang apart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Castle&rsquo;s won</i>, <i>the Castle&rsquo;s
won</i>!<br />
Ere he to join the dance had heart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For young King Erik Erikson</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And were it not for my lovely hair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Castle&rsquo;s won</i>, <i>the Castle&rsquo;s
won</i>!<br />
In that brave dance I&rsquo;d have a share,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For young King Erik Erikson</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>&ldquo;But for my cheeks so rosy red,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Castle&rsquo;s won</i>, <i>the Castle&rsquo;s
won</i>!<br />
The foremost in that dance I&rsquo;d tread,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For young King Erik Erikson</i>.</p>
<p>Then Ranild Lang to dance began,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Castle&rsquo;s won</i>, <i>the Castle&rsquo;s
won</i>!<br />
And a ditty sang as he led the van,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For young King Erik Erikson</i>.</p>
<p>Sweet he warbled, light he sprang,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Castle&rsquo;s won</i>, <i>the Castle&rsquo;s
won</i>!<br />
After him every warrior sang,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For young King Erik Erikson</i>.</p>
<p>Then up the Spendel Sko arose,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Castle&rsquo;s won</i>, <i>the Castle&rsquo;s
won</i>!<br />
And on Ranild Lang her troth bestows,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For young King Erik Erikson</i>.</p>
<p>With silk was snooded her hair of gold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Castle&rsquo;s won</i>, <i>the Castle&rsquo;s
won</i>!<br />
She danced before them free and bold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For young King Erik Erikson</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>And into the Castle they dance their way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Castle&rsquo;s won</i>, <i>the Castle&rsquo;s
won</i>!<br />
With drawn swords &rsquo;neath their scarlet array.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For young King Erik Erikson</i>.</p>
<p>Never, I ween, was a braver dance,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Castle&rsquo;s won</i>, <i>the Castle&rsquo;s
won</i>!<br />
It wins the Castle of Rosenkrands,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For young King Erik Erikson</i>.</p>

10</span> SONG THE SECOND.</h3>
<p>To saddle his courser Ranild cried:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For thus the tale was told to me</i>&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;To visit the rich Greve I will ride,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though banish&rsquo;d from the land we
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the house came Ranild spurring hard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For thus the tale was told to me</i>&mdash;<br />
There stood the Greve arrayed in mard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though banish&rsquo;d from the land we be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hail, hail, Sir Greve, arrayed so fine!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For thus the tale was told to me</i>&mdash;<br />
I want my bride, the little Kirstine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though banish&rsquo;d from the land I be.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>Then up and spoke her mother dear:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For thus the tale was told to me</i>&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Thou hast no bride, Sir Ranild, here,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For banish&rsquo;d from the land ye be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O if I can&rsquo;t my little bride get,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For thus the tale was told to me</i>&mdash;<br />
On fire your house and your gear I&rsquo;ll set,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though banish&rsquo;d from the land I be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O rather than ruin us in thy wrath,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For thus the tale was told to me</i>&mdash;<br />
Receive thy bride and ride thy path,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though banish&rsquo;d from the land ye
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They o&rsquo;er her threw the blue cloak with speed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For thus the tale was told to me</i>&mdash;<br />
And placed her upon Sir Ranild&rsquo;s steed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though banish&rsquo;d from the land he be.</p>
<p>They had for their bridal bed alone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For thus the tale was told to ne</i>&mdash;<br />
The holt, the field, and the mead new mown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For banish&rsquo;d from the land they be.</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>&ldquo;The forest can hear, and the mead can view,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For thus the tale was told to me</i>&mdash;<br />
We here must live as outlaws do,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For banish&rsquo;d from the land we be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadst thou not helped the King to slay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For thus the tale was told to me</i>&mdash;<br />
In peace at home we now might stay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But banish&rsquo;d from the land we be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He struck her a blow the table o&rsquo;er,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For thus the tale was told to me</i>&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Should&rsquo;st guard thy tongue, child, guests before,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though banish&rsquo;d from the land we
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He struck her on her face so fair:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For thus the tale was told to me</i>&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;In Erik&rsquo;s death I had no share,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though banished from the land I be.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>SONG THE THIRD.</h3>
<p>So wide around the tidings bound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That Ranild&rsquo;s prisoner taken;<br />
Had he been aware how it would fare<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He had not Hielm forsaken.<br />
The death of woe, spaed long ago,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll wreak on him now, I reckon.</p>
<p>Into the hall steps Ranild tall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And withouten trepidation;<br />
Bids his Lord good bye, and the chivalry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who have at court their station.<br />
O, Lord Christ! be each man kept free<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From misfortune and tribulation.</p>
<p><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>&ldquo;In mind dost bear, King Erik dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On whom may blessings pour,<br />
That service I wrought in your father&rsquo;s court,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of all his swains the flower?<br />
Both in and out I&rsquo;ve borne you about<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In sunshine and in shower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, service you wrought in my father&rsquo;s court,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; For money and clothes imparted,<br />
And betrayed his life to the foeman&rsquo;s knife,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a monster treacherous hearted.<br />
And as sure as now the crown&rsquo;s on my brow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the wheel thou shalt be carted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hew off, I intreat, my hands and feet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Most willingly them I proffer;<br />
My eyes blood red tear out of my head,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the worst death let me suffer;<br />
But all the pains that Ranild gains<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For his treason scarce enough are.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>&ldquo;Thine eyeballs twain thou may&rsquo;st retain,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thy hands and feet unriven;<br />
But thou thy breath shalt yield to a death<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The cruellest under heaven;<br />
And be it known, for my father alone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This punishment is given.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ranild they brought from Roskild out,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He wrung his hands with sorrow;<br />
And the women all salt tears let fall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who lived in that ancient borough.<br />
The wretched wight wished all good night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And a light heart on the morrow.</p>
<p>Ranild they bore the town before,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The wheel his sight saluted:<br />
&ldquo;Christ guard each noble from such like trouble,&rdquo;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In agony he shouted,<br />
&ldquo;If at Hielm I&rsquo;d staid it had better sped,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor to that had I been devoted.</p>
<p><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>&ldquo;Would God would send a trusty friend,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who would my message carry,<br />
To Kirstine fair, who sits in care,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To Ranild true to tarry.<br />
O Christ help all my babies small,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bless my bosom&rsquo;s dearie!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye Christian folk, whom, with dying look,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On the mead I am discerning,<br />
A pater pray for my soul, to stay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of God the anger burning;<br />
That me He receive this very eve<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the joys for which I&rsquo;m yearning.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL</h2>
<p>Child Stig and Child Findal two brothers were they,<br />
There ne&rsquo;er were two brothers more gallant and gay.</p>
<p>Child Stig serves the Dane King in bower and hall,<br />
High dames brushed his hair, and fair maidens withal.</p>
<p>Child Stig by the board of the Monarch he stood,<br />
To him little Kirstin was cruel of mood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Full seven years I have been Lord of the Rune,<br />
Of its power I&rsquo;ll make trial this same
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>With his right hand he skinked the wine and the mead<br
/>
And cast with his left the Rune characters dread.</p>
<p>To cast them on Kirstin the gallant Stig meant,<br />
But under the dress of Rigissa they went.</p>
<p>O pallid as ashes the gallant Stig grew,<br />
And red as the blood was Rigissa to view.</p>
<p>The gallant Child Stig placed his cap on his head,<br />
And unto his foster dame&rsquo;s chamber he sped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Foster dame, give me some counsel, I pray,<br />
How I may escape from this palace away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To cast the Rune letters at Kirstin I meant,<br />
But under the dress of Rigissa they went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will mount my good courser so true and so tried,<br
/>
And away to the ends of the earth I will ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>Said she: &ldquo;Shouldst thou travel all Finland
around,<br />
This night at thy couch will Rigissa be found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And e&rsquo;en shouldst thou ride to the earth&rsquo;s
farthest land,<br />
This night by thy couch she will certainly stand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Child Stig, I advise thee, call up a good
heart,<br />
And home to thy bed and thy slumbers depart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll tap on the door of thy chamber, I ween,<br
/>
But still do thou keep, let her in by no mean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But ten fingers has she, so tiny and small,<br />
And with them from the door she will pick the nails all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will set herself down on the side of thy bed,<br />
And play with the long yellow locks of thy head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So fondly she&rsquo;ll stroke thy fair cheek in the
dark,<br />
But do thou remain as thou wert stiff and stark.</p>
<p><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll kiss thee full oft on thy lips rosy
red,<br />
But do thou lie still as were life from thee fled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Child Stig he gave ear to his foster dame&rsquo;s rede,<br />
And away to his bed he betook him with speed.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas late in the even, and down fell the dew,<br />
Rigissa flung o&rsquo;er her her mantle of blue.</p>
<p>The lovely maid she her blue mantle put on,<br />
And unto the chamber of Stig she is gone.</p>
<p>On the door of the chamber begins she to knock:<br />
&ldquo;Arise, O Child Stig, and thy chamber unlock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the Ting to appear, I have summoned no wight,<br />
And none I&rsquo;ll admit to my chamber at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s fingers, ten fingers, so tiny and small,<br />
And out of the door she has picked the nails all.</p>
<p>Fifteen iron nails, and a big stud of brass,<br />
Then into the chamber Rigissa could pass.</p>
<p><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>She sat herself down by the side of the bed,<br />
And played with the locks of the young gallant&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>She kissed him full oft on his mouth rosy red,<br />
But still he remained as were life from him fled.</p>
<p>In her arms the young Stig she so fondly did press,<br />
But quiet he lay nor returned her caress.</p>
<p>Child Stig he awoke, and cast up his eyes:<br />
&ldquo;Who wakes me from sleep in this manner?&rdquo; he
cries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I cannot, Rigissa, my rest for thee take,<br />
To the Dane King, thy brother, complaint I will make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O thou may&rsquo;st complain if thou feelest
inclin&rsquo;d,<br />
But thou art the man on whom standeth my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The very next morning ere high was the sun,<br />
Child Stig to complain to the Dane King is gone.</p>
<p><!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>&ldquo;Dear Lord, I have this to complain of to thee,<br
/>
For thy sister at night I at rest cannot be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King in displeasure his footboy address&rsquo;d:<br />
&ldquo;To come to my presence my sister request.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rigissa came in, &rsquo;fore the table stood she:<br />
&ldquo;What mean&rsquo;st thou, O brother, by sending for
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O here is a knight doth complaint of thee make,<br />
He cannot at night his repose for thee take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is but God&rsquo;s truth that his chamber I
sought,<br />
But nothing unseemly betwixt us was wrought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steel, glowing steel, I will bear on my hand,<br />
And of crime with Child Stig I acquitted will stand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long stood the Dane King, full of thought was his head:<br />
&ldquo;With no better man I my sister can wed.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>All hearts in the Dane King&rsquo;s palace were gay,<br
/>
The Dane King has given his sister away.</p>
<p>There was pleasure and smiling in every look,<br />
For his beloved Lady Child Stig the maid took.</p>
<p>Child Stig he brews ale, and the wine doth prepare,<br />
He the Dane King invites to his castle so fair.</p>
<p>The King and his gallant men all biddeth he,<br />
And the Queen of the Danes of the party should be.</p>
<p>Outspake the fair Queen, on her steed as she rode:<br />
&ldquo;Methinks I behold of Child Stig the abode.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thereto the page at her bridle replied:<br />
&ldquo;Of Stig the brave castle is known far and wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Within with the richest of gold it is graced,<br />
Without with white silver &rsquo;tis all over cased.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>And, lo, when the gate of the castle they gained,<br />
Five shaggy white bears stood before it enchained.</p>
<p>And when in procession they entered the court,<br />
Within it the hart and the roebuck did sport.</p>
<p>In the midst of the court was a silver trough long,<br />
Of birds and of animals round it a throng.</p>
<p>Above spread the poplar and linden their shade,<br />
In its coolness the hart and the little hind played.</p>
<p>An apartment they entered, full lofty and fair,<br />
Was crowded with women so courtly of air.</p>
<p>All of red amber composed was the floor,<br />
The roof with gilt letters was written all o&rsquo;er.</p>
<p>The table it was of the red shining gold<br />
The napkin of Agerwool rare to behold.</p>
<p><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>The walls were constructed of fair marble stone,<br />
The beams of the roof of the whitest whale bone.</p>
<p>On the floor they are dancing with rapture so high,<br />
Tall, slender, and stately Sir Stig dances by.</p>
<p>Straight and slim as a sapling Child Stig dances up,<br />
In each hand holding a fair silver cup.</p>
<p>Child Stig to the health of his bonny bride quaffed,<br />
And forest and meadow delightedly laughed.</p>
<p>The forest it bloomed, the boughs leaves put forth&mdash;<br
/>
She excels every damsel in beauty and worth.</p>
<p>Late in the evening the mist it descends,<br />
Child Stig his young bride to her chamber attends.</p>
<p><!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>Now gallant Child Stig has o&rsquo;ercome his
distress,<br />
He sleeps in the arm of a lovely princess.</p>
<p>And Damsel Rigissa is free from her fright,<br />
By the side of Child Stig she reposes each night.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
